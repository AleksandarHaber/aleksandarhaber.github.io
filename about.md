My name is Aleksandar Haber and currently, I am an engineering professor at the City University of New York (College of Staten Island). I have a Ph.D. degree
in control theory from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, and I was also a postdoctoral fellow at the Physics and Astronomy Department at 
Northwestern University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, numerical linear algebra, optimization, dynamical systems, and machine learning.
